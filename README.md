# the-gallery-project1

I developed a software application to assist a gallery manager to track information relating to artists and exhibits. 
I built this application using Ruby, Sinatra, SQL and included visual design using HTML and CSS. 
I applied UX methods such as user persona and user journeys to ensure the application communicates effectively with the user.
